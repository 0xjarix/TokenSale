## Summary

Token presale and public sale where contributors receive tokens in exchange of providing ETH.
They can get refunded as long as the min contribution is not met for presale and for public sale.
Owner can update the contribution cap and can distribute tokens to an address.
In both the presale and public sale the xchange rate is the same: 1 ETH = 1000 token.
